# Bellabeat_case_study
Case Study Capstone Project for Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate

In this case study, I imagine I am working for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturere of health-focused products for women, and meet different characters and team members. In order to answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. I have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat's products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights I discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. I will present my analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with my high-level recommendations for Bellabeat's marketing strategy.
